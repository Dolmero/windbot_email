#Installation
* Download the file **windbotemail.jar** from above.
* Put **windbotemail.jar** inside your windbot screenshot folder for me it is **_G:\WindBot\screenshots_**
* Start it and enter an email and a password for a Gmail. You can have the same sender and receiver.
* Press Send!

#Testing
If you want to test if it sends anything, you can:
* Copy an image to the folder.
 _OR_
* Rename an already existing screenshot in the folder.

#Notes
* This program will attempt send anything new that enters the folder of the .jar file.
* When a program like this asks for your gmail acc/pass then you probably want to make a new Gmail instead of using your main one. Making a new one will work fine.
